                    <p>Over the previous couple of months, we wrote about the vast range of possible applications that digital signage offers, and how it can be used to support your organization and improve your visitors’ experience. So, if you haven’t had a chance read about those topics yet, feel free to take a few moments and go through some of our previous articles to find out why your business should use digital signage, how to use it effectively, and how to get the most out of your digital signage.<br></p>

So without further ado, let’s get the ball rolling!<br></p>

                    <p>It can pull data in realtime from a vast array of online sources, such as websites and blogs, company news, sport channels, local news, real-estate agents and houses, public transportation information, airports, movies, social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Linkedin, Instagram, Flickr), etc. The possibilities are almost endless.<br></p>
                    <p>So, whether it’s a local image, a video, an online news source, or a social media feed that you want to integrate into your digital signage channel –&nbsp;<strong>our product has you covered</strong>!<br></p>

                    <p>Due to its multifunctional nature, our product can easily be integrated and used in almost any environment or facility where you want to distribute information efficiently and increase the visitor experience. These types of facilities include educational institutions, modern office complexes, train stations, waiting rooms, etc. The list goes on and on. Practically any modern environment that you can possibly imagine can be upgraded using our product as your digital signage software solution!<br></p>
                    <p>Another very important aspect that we cannot fail to mention lies in our product’s&nbsp;<strong>efficiency</strong>&nbsp;when it comes to distribution of information. Since everything runs in the cloud, it only takes a couple of mouse clicks to change and update any content that appears on your channel. This can be done from any physical location around the globe as long as you have internet connectivity.&nbsp;<br></p>
                    <p>Our product also allows you to leverage the cloud technology to immediately change the content on one digital signage screen, as well as hundreds or even thousands of different screens. All the changes you make are applied and propagated throughout your network of screens in&nbsp;<strong>a matter of seconds</strong>!<br></p>
                    <hr>
                    <h2 class="display-4">Create Rich Content that Tells Your Brand Story!<br></h2>
                    <p>Now that you have a pretty good understanding about the possibilities our product offers, we would like to show you just how easy and straightforward it is to create content for your digital signage channel. With our software, you will become a digital signage expert in no time!<br></p>
                    <p>So let’s dive in together and go through all the major elements of the interface one step at a time.<br></p>
                    <h3>Slide Creator<br></h3>
                    <p>The main interface of the app is divided into several modules. The slide creator module lets you easily create presentation slides for your digital signage channel. It allows you to save a master template of your presentation so that you can easily reuse it later. This makes the entire process of making later presentations a lot quicker and easier.<br></p>
                    <figure class="figure"><img class="rounded img-fluid figure-img border border-secondary" src="assets/img/castit-slide-creator.png?h=de9bd8be866e47e9ac5c90c4c4c35704" alt="Slide creator">

                    </figure>
                    <h3>Library<br></h3>
                    <p>The library module lets you store all your content using our cloud infrastructure. This way, all your content remains safely stored online and can be used at any time and from any computer. In addition, all your assets can also be broadcast onto any screen(s) of your choice. Our cloud storage allows you to structure your content any way that is convenient for you by using folder structure.<br></p>

                    </figure>
                    <h3>Apps and Integrations<br></h3>
                    <p>The apps and integrations module is one of the most important sections of our digital signage platform. It contains more than 50 apps that are easily integrated into your channel and can help you extend your broadcast in almost any way you can imagine.<br></p>
                    <p>These apps allow you to pull the existing information from the web directly onto your screen, information from various news sources, social media feeds, train schedules, etc. This can save you a lot of time, since you don’t need to enter new information manually every time it changes and you have unrestricted access to up-to-date information at all times.<br></p>
                    <p>Most importantly, we are also able to develop custom new apps based on the specifications of your organization.<br></p>
                    <figure class="figure"><img class="rounded img-fluid figure-img border border-secondary" src="assets/img/castit-apps-and-integrations.png?h=651559cd761bfb241abe1ef2a2803dc3" alt="Apps and Integrations">

                    </figure>
                    <h3>Playlists<br></h3>
                    <p>Your whole broadcast is structured using a playlist format. Playlists allow you to fill them with various media types from your library and set the desired amount of their duration.<br></p>
                    <p>Our platform lets you create as many playlists as you prefer. This allows you to have a separate playlist for every theme or demographic. You can have a number of specialized playlists that you can use during different times of day or to target different groups of people.<br></p>
                    <figure class="figure"><img class="rounded img-fluid figure-img border border-secondary" src="assets/img/castit-playlists.png?h=d818e6bf4bca50f9e8bd28ffaadfd727" alt="Playlists">

                    </figure>
                    <h3>Screen Preview<br></h3>
                    <p>Naturally, you would want to know exactly what your channel is going to look like before you broadcast it in your organization. Or perhaps you want to show it to some of your colleagues and ask them for their feedback and opinions. Our product has you covered here as well. We have made a convenient preview screen exactly for this purpose. It lets you preview all the broadcasts you have created and see which broadcasts are currently being played.<br></p>
                    <figure class="figure"><img class="rounded img-fluid figure-img border border-secondary" src="assets/img/castit-screen-preview.png?h=a9160b419ba9a4ca4e45a1dd462649bf" alt="Screen Preview">

                    </figure>
                    <h2 class="display-4">Custom Hardware and Multiplatform Support<br></h2>
                    <p>Another advantage of our digital signage solution is that it can run on multiple platforms. There are separate versions for Windows and Linux operating systems, as well as for the Android mobile operating system. This means that you don’t need to have an external media player, since you can install the player on most computers, tablets and smart TVs.<br></p>
                    <p>However, if you do require more computing power to play those high resolution videos or run CPU intensive apps or maybe broadcast your digital signage channel in areas that have poor internet connection, we can provide you with a specialized media player that we have build specifically for this purpose.<br></p>
                    <h2 class="display-4">Multiple Pricing Models<br></h2>
                    <p>Our digital signage platform comes in several pricing plans to help you find the right solution that fits your needs and your budget.<br></p>
                    <h3>Basic Plan<br></h3>
                    <p>The basic plan allows you to use our entire platform, including all the apps completely free of charge! You can broadcast any content you desire to one screen using the web app and you also get email support.<br></p>
                    <h3><strong>Professional Plan</strong><br></h3>
                    <p>The professional plan is a subscription model that costs 19€ per month. You get license for one player, plus all the features and benefits included in the basic plan.<br></p>
