                    <p>Pubs and bars are a meeting place for people from all walks of life who seek an opportunity to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. They give you an opportunity to unwind, catch up with your friends and share a few laughs over a few beers in a comfortable, laid-back setting. They are open every day of the week and always ready to welcome the next customer.<br></p>
                    <p>If you try to visualize a typical bar setting, an image of a TV hanging from the wall and showing the current sporting events often comes to mind. The TV screen is always somewhere in the background, and we are accustomed to always keep an eye on it or at least check it from time to time. However, the question that begs to be asked is – can this typical image of a bar somehow be improved using the technology that we have at our disposal today?<br></p>
                    <h2 class="display-4">Introducing Digital Signage for Pubs and Bars!<br></h2>
                    <p>Digital signage is the perfect way to increase the experience of visitors that frequent your pub. No matter whether it’s showing your latest drink offers and promotions or telling your customers about the rich and vibrant history of the place, digital signage is an effective means to increase your revenue stream and provide more value to your customers.<br></p>
                    <p>When used correctly, digital signage can act as a natural extension of your facility, contributing to its overall look and feel and complementing the general atmosphere of the place. In this article, we’d like to go over some of the most popular ways in which you can use digital signage to increase the visitor experience in your pub.<br></p>
                    <h2 class="display-4">Display a Digital Menu Board<br></h2>
                    <p>Please stop living in the dark ages and using a chalkboard to show your best menu deals to your visitors. Digital menu boards are a great way to take advantage of digital signage for this purpose. They are extremely easy and straightforward to set up, and you can easily edit their contents any way you see fit. For example, when your current special offer is over, you can easily change it for another one with just a few clicks of a mouse. Likewise, when you go out of stock on an item from your selling list, you can easily replace it with another one.<br></p>
                    <p>An additional advantage of digital menu boards is that they give you a chance to present your best menu items in high resolution, with enticing images of your most refreshing drinks and delicious food. This is a sure way to attract new visitors and increase your sales figures.<br></p>
                    <h2 class="display-4">Advertise Your Food and Drink Offers<br></h2><img class="rounded img-fluid" src="assets/img/bar-menu.webp?h=a834992d0d70095a22e8f70372ad2a30" alt="Bar menu" loading="auto" style="margin-top: 20px;">
                    <p style="color: var(--bs-secondary);margin-top: 5px;font-size: 15px;">Image: Canva</p>
                    <p>Another way you can take advantage of digital signage is to place it in the most visible spot in your pub and direct the attention of your customers towards the items whose sales you’d like to increase. This is a great way for you to advertise your happy hour discounts and promotions. On the other hand, you’ll also keep your customers happy because they’ll be able to take advantage of the great deals you’re giving them.<br></p>
                    <p>In addition, since it is very easy to change the content presented on the display, you can create different promotions for different occasions. For example, you can promote one offer during weekdays and a completely different one during weekends. Or perhaps you’d prefer to have one promotion during daytime and another one during evening hours. Digital signage makes all this possible!<br></p>
                    <p>Lastly, since digital signage is not limited to static content, you can display rich motion graphics on your screens. Why not use this to your advantage to increase beverage consumption in your pub? For example, you can show an appealing video of how some of the popular cocktails are made, what ingredients go into them and where these ingredients originate from. This surely beats the old, conventional way of putting an image of a drink and placing a price tag next to it.<br></p>
                    <h2 class="display-4">Advertise Your Pub Events and Important Notices<br></h2><img class="rounded img-fluid" src="assets/img/pub-quiz.webp?h=6764642df630b232a57fab0e85fd577f" alt="Pub quiz ad" loading="auto" style="margin-top: 20px;">
                    <p style="color: var(--bs-secondary);margin-top: 5px;font-size: 15px;">Image: Canva</p>
                    <p>If you ever had the habit of frequenting pubs, you are surely aware that they tend to host a wide variety of past-time activities. The most frequent of these is the infamous pub quiz, which allows your pub clientele to show off with their general knowledge and intellectual abilities over a few glasses of beer. Why not use digital signage to promote these events to your visitors or to publish weekly results in the form of leaderboards on the big screen. The same applies to any pool, darts or table tennis tournament that your pub decides to host.<br></p>
                    <p>In addition, digital signage allows you to better connect with the pub community. You can use it to display pub news, emergency announcements and all sorts of different messages to your customers. After all, one of the major selling points of digital signage is that it allows you to distribute relevant information quickly and efficiently.<br></p>
                    <h2 class="display-4">Provide Advertising Space<br></h2>
                    <p>Are you looking for a full-proof way to increase the revenue of your pub using digital signage? Then why not sell a bit of advertising space to local business owners? You’ll be surprised to see how little advertising time is needed to fully cover your digital signage installation costs. And, if you are a large pub owner or own a chain of pubs, why not go global and consider advertising different brands of lager or lager suppliers.<br></p>
                    <h2 class="display-4">Take Advantage of Social Media<br></h2>
                    <p>Social media is a great tool to create and nourish the bond between you and your customers. If your pub is active on social media, you can easily display your social media content on your digital signage display. Share your pub’s posts from Facebook, Twitter or Instagram to encourage more visitors to follow your pub online and build up your online presence. In addition, you can make your customers feel special by reposting their social media posts and displaying them on your digital signage channel.<br></p>
                    <h2 class="display-4">Advertise the Next Big Sporting Event and Show Live Scores<br></h2><img class="rounded img-fluid" src="assets/img/sports-event.webp?h=01c179b48a14125318055bd0ab311ebf" alt="Sports event ad" loading="auto" style="margin-top: 20px;">
                    <p style="color: var(--bs-secondary);margin-top: 5px;font-size: 15px;">Image: Canva</p>
                    <p>Let your customers know that they can watch the next big sports match right in the comfort of your pub. Yes, while putting a big sign in front of your entrance is certainly an option, nothing beats having the next big event announced with a flashing message right on your digital signage display. A further advantage of doing things this way is that you will save the time and cost of printing out a different poster every week for each of the upcoming events. In addition, you can keep your customers entertained and up-to-date by showing them the latest live scores from your favorite sports channels.<br></p>
                    <h2 class="display-4">Show Personalized Texts and Messages<br></h2>
                    <p>Displaying personalized messages for your visitors is a great way to increase hospitality for your customers and at the same time earn a little money on the side. This is yet another area where digital signage can help. So, next time your guests gather to celebrate a birthday or an anniversary, why not make their experience a lot more enjoyable and personal by giving them your best wishes on the big screen. These little things tend to go a long way, and they nourish brand loyalty among your customers.<br></p>
                    <h2 class="display-4">Display News, Weather, Time and Traffic Information<br></h2>
                    <p>Last but not least, digital signage can help you keep your customers informed with relevant and up-to-date information about the world. After all, this is one of the most important uses of digital signage. This way, you can create a comfortable environment for your visitors by keeping them aware about the time, current news and weather conditions in your area.<br></p>

                    <h2 class="display-4">The Benefits of Using Digital Signage in Pubs and Bars<br></h2>
                    <h3 style="padding-top: 20px;">Save Time and Money<br></h3>
                    <p>In addition to being more efficient and straightforward to use, digital signage is also considerably cheaper than regular signage. By choosing digital signage, you cut the costs of paper printing, its distribution and waste management. Likewise, digital signage allows you to save a lot of time, since you can update your screen(s) automatically and as often as the needs of your business require.<br></p>
                    <h3>Communicate Efficiently with Your Customers<br></h3>
                    <p>In today’s competitive landscape, efficient communication is essential in any line of business. Here as well, digital signage allows you to quickly and efficiently communicate your messages to your customers and avoid any possible information delays and bottlenecks.<br></p>
                    <h3>Promote Your Products to Increase Sales<br></h3>
                    <p>The right combination of powerful text, images and videos can have a major impact on you customers’ purchasing decisions. Approximately 80% of brands that choose digital signage experience a sales increase of up to 33%.<br></p>
                    <h3>Additional Revenue Stream from Advertising<br></h3>
                    <p>When you install digital signage in your facility, you get full control of your advertising. You can have your digital screen work for you by earning additional revenue from the business you choose to advertise on your channel.<br></p>
                    <h3>Improve Customer Experience<br></h3>
                    <p>It is a known fact that digital screens capture 400% more views compared to static images. Not only do they capture more views, but their recall rate is 83% – significantly higher than any other media. This makes it very easy to attract new and keep old customers.<br></p>
                    <h3>Reinforce Your Brand Image<br></h3>
                    <p>A lot of businesses find it difficult to promote their brand identity. With digital signage, however, you can easily create the look and feel of your channel that closely matches your brand and reinforce your brand’s image.<br></p>
