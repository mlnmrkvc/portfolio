                    <h2 class="display-2" style="margin-top: 0px;">Why is On-Page SEO Important?<br></h2>
                    <p>No matter how good your website is, on-page Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is essential to building an online presence and ranking high in Search Results Pages (SERPs). With well over a billion sites on the internet competing for the number one spot in SERPs, it is important now more than ever to get familiar with on-page SEO and know how to use it to optimize your site for search engines. After all, there's no point in building an amazing site if no one ever sees it, is there?<br></p>
                    <p>This blog post is a comprehensive guide that covers all major aspects of on-page SEO. If you keep reading, you’ll find out how to improve the visibility of your site, drive more organic traffic, increase the number of leads and your potential customers.<br></p>
                    <p>So, let’s start exploring each of the aspects of on-page SEO one at a time. And, by the time you finish reading this article, you’ll find yourself equipped with all the necessary skills to boost the performance of your site.<br></p>
                    <h2 class="display-2" style="margin-top: 0px;">Integrate Keywords into Your Main Body Content<br></h2>
                    <p>Search engines use very sophisticated algorithms to rank pages, and those algorithms are growing more and more complex after each update to deliver the most relevant results for your searches. One of the very important criteria that search engines employ to rank your pages in SERPs is what keywords you use and their relationship to the rest of the content on your page. <br></p><img class="rounded img-fluid" src="assets/img/Word%20cloud%20of%20keywords.jpg?h=34ce98c71c201f7e71c2f6f5842e870b" alt="A hand with a chalk hovering over a word cloud background"><!-- Start: Caption -->
                    <p style="color: var(--bs-secondary);margin-top: 5px;font-size: 15px;">Image: Adobe Express</p><!-- End: Caption -->
                    <p>This is why it's important to do a proper keyword research first and to understand what your potential visitors are looking for. After you complete the keyword research process, you will be able to optimize your site content around the keywords that you want to rank for in SERPs. <br></p>
                    <p>Today, there are a lot of tools available on the market, both paid and free, that will make the process of finding new keywords for your site easier. Some of the more popular ones include:&nbsp;<a href="https://ads.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/" target="_blank">Google Keyword Planner</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://ahrefs.com/" target="_blank">Ahrefs</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.semrush.com/" target="_blank">Semrush</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://moz.com/" target="_blank">Moz</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://surferseo.com/keyword-surfer-extension/" target="_blank">Keyword Surfer</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://keywordseverywhere.com/" target="_blank">Keywords Everywhere</a>, etc.&nbsp;These can help you find the right keywords in your niche and provide you with a lot of useful statistics to help you decide whether a particular keyword is worth targeting or not.<br></p>
                    <p>When you start optimizing your main content for keywords, try to make your primary keyword flow naturally in your content. Place it somewhere near the top of your text, preferably somewhere in the first paragraph, and then carefully scatter your primary and your secondary keyword throughout the rest of your text. <br></p>
                    <p>However, be careful not to go overboard. Don’t try to cram your keywords as many times as possible into your content hoping that your page will rank higher. This practice, known as keyword stuffing, can hurt your site in several of ways. First and foremost, your content will sound confusing and unnatural to your readers and may drive them away from your site altogether. Secondly, you might get penalized by the search engine for trying to manipulate the web crawler algorithm, and your site rankings may plummet. <br></p>
                    <h2 class="display-2">Optimize Your Title Tags</h2>
                    <p>Another very important aspect of on-page SEO is optimizing the title tag of your site. So, what exactly is the title tag? The title tag is an html element of your page that lets search engines know what the main topic of your page is. If you take a look at the html code of a page, you'll find that the title tag looks something like this:<br></p>
                    <p class="font-monospace" style="font-size: 18px;font-family: 'Roboto Mono', monospace;"><span style="color: rgb(214, 51, 132);">&lt;title&gt;On-Page SEO: The Ultimate Guide to Maximum Visibility&lt;/title&gt;</span><br></p>
                    <p>At the same time, the title tag is the element that most prominently displays your page in SERPs. It is the first thing that your visitors see when they search for something and your page pops up. <br></p><img class="rounded img-fluid" src="assets/img/Meta%20Title.webp?h=a56d8dbab089b8c9d748d4a0a00912d4" alt="A meta title in Google search results page"><!-- Start: Caption -->
                    <p style="color: var(--bs-secondary);margin-top: 5px;font-size: 15px;">Image: Google</p><!-- End: Caption -->
                    <p>This is why the title tag is one of the most important page elements for on-page SEO optimization. It has the power to entice or drive away your potential visitors, depending on how well (or poorly) it’s written. <br></p>

                    <h3 style="margin-right: 0px;margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>Tips for Writing Effective Title Tags:</strong><br></h3>
                    <ul class="list-group">
                        <li class="list-group-item">
                            <h4><strong>Keep Your Title Tags Short</strong><br></h4>
                            <p>Since the space where search engines show page titles is limited, a good rule of thumb is to keep your meta titles under 60 characters (including spaces). Otherwise, they're going to appear truncated in SERPs.<br></p><img class="rounded img-fluid" src="assets/img/Meta%20Title%20Truncated.png?h=a10409b27da98b28d31c7267d5565d47" alt="A truncated meta title in Google search results page"><!-- Start: Caption -->
                            <p style="color: var(--bs-secondary);margin-top: 5px;font-size: 15px;">Image: Google</p><!-- End: Caption -->
                        </li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">
                            <h4><strong>Include Relevant Keywords</strong><br></h4>
                            <p>Another good practice is to include your primary keyword in your title tag. Try to place it somewhere toward the beginning of your title if possible. You can also add your secondary keyword as well, but make sure that your title sounds natural. Avoid keyword stuffing in your title tags.<br></p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">
                            <h4>Keep Your Title Tags Relevant<br></h4>
                            <p>Make sure that your title tags are relevant to the content on your page, and that they describe your page accurately. Don’t use clickbait or misleading titles, as they can hurt the credibility and reputation of your site.<br></p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2 class="display-2" style="margin-top: 30px;">Write Compelling Meta Descriptions<br></h2>
                    <p>The meta description is an html element that gives a short summary of your page to search engines. This is what a meta description looks like when you look at the html code of your page:<br></p><!-- Start: Code Custom -->
                    <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Mono', monospace;font-size: 18px;"><span style="color: rgb(214, 51, 132);">&lt;meta name="description" content="Short description of your page content"</span></p><!-- End: Code Custom -->
                    <p>In SERPs, the meta description of your page appears below the page title. <br></p><img class="rounded img-fluid" src="assets/img/Meta%20Description.webp?h=a68accceee6b34babe474fc64c1e54c0" alt="A meta description in Google search results page"><!-- Start: Caption -->
                    <p style="color: var(--bs-secondary);margin-top: 5px;font-size: 15px;">Image: Google</p><!-- End: Caption -->
                    <p>Even though meta descriptions don’t directly influence SERP rankings, they are a very important factor when it comes to on-page SEO. A well-worded meta description can dramatically increase visits to your site and improve your click-through rates.<br></p>
                    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>Best Practices for Writing Meta Descriptions:</strong><br></h3>
                    <ul class="list-group">
                        <li class="list-group-item">
                            <h4><strong>Keep Your Meta Descriptions Succinct</strong><br></h4>
                            <p>Like meta titles, there's limited space for meta descriptions you can use in SERPs before they get truncated. This is why it’s best to keep your meta descriptions below 160 characters (including spaces). So, keep your meta descriptions concise, and try to focus on the most important information from your page.<br></p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">
                            <h4><strong>Include Your Primary Keyword</strong><br></h4>
                            <p>Include your primary keyword in your meta description. Search engines will highlight it when they show the meta description of your page and make it stand out more in SERPs. Use this to attract your visitors.<br></p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">
                            <h4><strong>Make Your Meta Descriptions Relevant</strong><br></h4>
                            <p>Make sure that your meta description accurately reflects the content of your page. As with meta titles, don’t use clickbait or misleading meta descriptions. While this shady practice may bring you some small short-term benefits, it will hurt your site’s credibility in the long run and you will lose your visitors. <br></p>
                            <p>Likewise, if search engines find that your meta descriptions do not accurately reflect the content on your page, they may replace them with a section of text from your page that they find most relevant. <br></p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2 class="display-2" style="margin-top: 20px;">Put Your Headline in the H1 Tag<br></h2>
                    <p>The heading tags divide your content into logical wholes. They make it more readable and help your visitors understand what your page is about. Heading tags are numbered in order of how important they are, and the H1 tag is the most important tag in the hierarchy of heading tags. The H1 tag is used to mark the headline on your page. It is usually positioned at the top of the page, and it is the first element that people notice when they visit your page. <br></p><img class="rounded img-fluid" src="assets/img/Big%20News.webp?h=7ca4288dbfb108c856ea3375d4d96af9" alt="A woman looking at her phone in surprise"><!-- Start: Caption -->
                    <p style="color: var(--bs-secondary);margin-top: 5px;font-size: 15px;">Image: Adobe Express</p><!-- End: Caption -->
                    <p>It is important to understand the difference between the H1 tag and the meta title of a page. Even though these html elements may seem similar at first glance, they are in fact quite different. The H1 tag is visible when someone visits your page, while the meta title element is only visible when your page shows up in SERPs. <br></p>
                    <h3><strong>Guidelines for Writing H1 Tags:</strong><br></h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The H1 tag should accurately reflect the rest of the content on your page. Your visitors and search engines will use it to understand what your page is about.</li>
                        <li>Unlike the meta title, there is no character limit when it comes to the H1 tag. Use this extra space to make your page titles count.</li>
                        <li>Include your primary keyword in your H1 tag. You can include your secondary keyword too, but make sure you don’t create a jarring experience for your visitors.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul></ul>
                    <h2 class="display-2">Create User-Friendly URL Slugs<br></h2>
                    <p>The term URL slug refers to the part of the URL that comes after the domain name of your page. It is an important area of on-page SEO, because it is used by both search engines and your visitors to determine what the content on your page is about.<br></p>
                    <h3><strong>Best Practices for URL Slugs:</strong><br></h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Try to keep your URL slugs as short as possible.</li>
                        <li>Don’t use spaces to separate words. Use hyphens instead.</li>
                        <li>Use only lowercase letters. This will make your URL slug more readable and memorable.</li>
                        <li>Avoid using long sequences of numbers and other non-alphanumeric characters.</li>
                        <li>Include your primary keyword in the URL slug, but remember - no keyword stuffing.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2 class="display-2" style="margin-top: 20px;">Add Image Alt-Text<br></h2>
                    <p>Image alt-text is used to describe the images on your site to people with impaired vision who rely on using screen readers. Similarly, since search engines are unable to see images, they use these descriptions to understand the contents of an image. <br></p>
                    <h3><strong>Guidelines for Image-Alt Text Optimization: </strong><br></h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Describe the image as accurately as possible. Don’t use generic or vague descriptions.</li>
                        <li>Try to keep your descriptions concise and below 125 characters (spaces included).</li>
                        <li>Add relevant keywords, if possible.</li>
                        <li>Don’t use descriptions that start with "image of" or "picture of".</li>
                        <li>Don’t use abbreviations, acronyms or non-standard characters.</li>
                        <li>Make sure that all images on your page contain image-alt text.</li>
                        <li>For decorative images that have no meaning, use the empty alt attribute (alt=""). Screen readers will ignore empty alt attributes.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2 class="display-2" style="margin-top: 20px;">Implement Structured Markup<br></h2>
                    <p>Structured markup (or schema markup) is standardized code created by <a href="https://schema.org">Schema.org</a>, which is used to help search engines better understand various page elements. This way, search engines can present different data types from your page directly in SERPs and improve the visibility and performance of your site. Here are some of the ways Google uses structured data in SERPs: <br></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The knowledge graph</li>
                        <li>Featured snippets</li>
                        <li>Product listings</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Below is an example of structured markup embedded in the source of a page, which displays a rich result for a recipe in SERPs.</p><img class="rounded img-fluid" src="assets/img/Structured%20Markup.webp?h=bf3223c4191dc6f5f19084141e94ac31"><!-- Start: Caption -->
                    <p style="color: var(--bs-secondary);margin-top: 5px;font-size: 15px;">Image: Google</p><!-- End: Caption -->
                    <p>Implementing structured data requires some knowledge of coding, since it involves adding specific tags and attributes directly to the html code of your page. However, nowadays there are tools, like Google’s <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/markup-helper/" target="_blank">Structured Data Markup Helper</a>, that make this job a lot easier for you. <br></p>
                    <h2 class="display-2">Use Internal Linking<br></h2>
                    <p>Internal linking is the process of creating links that connect different pages on your site. External linking, on the other hand, is when you create links from your site to another (or vice-versa). <br></p><img class="rounded img-fluid" src="assets/img/Puzzle%20Pieces.webp?h=23aa41b3b20101f39068414fe1898878" alt="Two hands holding two puzzle pieces which complete each other"><!-- Start: Caption -->
                    <p style="color: var(--bs-secondary);margin-top: 5px;font-size: 15px;">Image: Adobe Express</p><!-- End: Caption -->
                    <p>Internal linking is an important factor for on-page SEO for two reasons. Firstly, it helps search engines understand the relationship between different pages on your site. Secondly, it increases visitor engagement by encouraging them to spend more time on your site. <br></p>
                    <h3><strong>Internal linking tips:</strong><br></h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use descriptive anchor text that accurately describes the linked page. Don’t use generic descriptions like “Click Here”.</li>
                        <li>Link to pages that are relevant and provide useful information for your visitors.</li>
                        <li>Link high-authority pages to low-authority pages on your site&nbsp;to transfer link authority from the original page.</li>
                        <li>Create internal links to highlight new or updated content.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2 class="display-2" style="margin-top: 20px;">Optimize for Mobile<br></h2>
                    <p>According to Statista, more than 60% of all searches on Google are performed using mobile devices. This means that mobile devices can no longer be treated as a second-class citizen. In fact, did you know that Google prioritizes mobile over desktop indexing? It uses the mobile version of your site to rank your pages in SERPs, which makes mobile responsiveness an essential factor for on-page SEO. <br></p><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/297137/mobile-share-of-us-organic-search-engine-visits/" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://www.statista.com/graphic/1/297137/mobile-share-of-us-organic-search-engine-visits.jpg" alt="Statistic: Mobile share of organic search engine visits in the United States from 3rd quarter 2013 to 4th quarter 2021 | Statista" style="width: 100%; height: auto !important; max-width:1000px;-ms-interpolation-mode: bicubic;"/></a><br />Find more statistics at  <a href="https://www.statista.com" rel="nofollow">Statista</a>
                    <p>In addition, creating a mobile-friendly site improves visitor experience, reduces bounce rates and increases customer satisfaction for your mobile users.<br></p>
                    <p>Fortunately, Google provides the free&nbsp;<a href="https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly" target="_blank">Mobile Friendly Test</a>&nbsp;that can show you how your site behaves on mobile devices. Just add your site URL, and it will tell you whether your site is usable on mobile or not. If not, it will present you with a list of issues that it encountered during testing that you can address.<br></p><img class="rounded img-fluid border" src="assets/img/Mobile-Friendly%20Test.png?h=66de27ece1c35ba96518de1a772ef7c3" alt="Google mobile friendly test results"><!-- Start: Caption -->

                    <h2 class="display-2" style="margin-top: 20px;">Improve Your Site's Loading Speed<br></h2>
                    <p>Finally, another very important aspect of on-page SEO is site speed. Your site needs to load fast on desktop and mobile devices. In today's age of powerful servers and fast internet speeds, running a site that loads slowly or scrolls sluggishly is simply not acceptable. This is why sites with fast loading times are ranked higher by search engines than those with slower loading speeds. <br></p>
                    <p>Here as well, Google made a handy tool called&nbsp;<a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev" target="_blank">PageSpeed Insights</a>&nbsp;that can help you diagnose your site speed problems. Add the URL of the page that you want to test, and you’ll get a report of your site’s core vitals and a comprehensive list of problems that prevent your site from loading quickly.<br></p><img class="rounded img-fluid" src="assets/img/Page%20Speed%20Insights.webp?h=0ca576cf02ad7c47def2c0a4b832c6c1" alt="Google page speed insights test results"><!-- Start: Caption -->

                    <h2 class="display-2" style="margin-top: 20px;">Conclusion<br></h2>
                    <p>And so, this brings us to the end of our comprehensive guide to on-page SEO. We covered all the essential aspects of on-page SEO, including adding relevant keywords to your body content, fine-tuning your page title tags, writing effective meta descriptions and H1 tags, optimizing your URL slugs and adding descriptive alt-text to your images. We also discussed structured data, internal linking strategies, optimizing your site for mobile devices and site loading speed. By following these guidelines, you'll be able to improve the visibility and ranking of your site in no time.</p>
                    <p>However, please keep in mind that on-page SEO is just one part of the SEO&nbsp;equation, along with off-page SEO and technical SEO. Each of these three components is equally important to execute a successful long-term SEO strategy. For example, you should come up with a solid strategy for acquiring quality backlinks from authoritative sources. Additionally, you should utilize social media marketing to increase brand awareness and drive more traffic to your site. Finally, don't forget to take into account the technical aspect of SEO, which includes creating page redirects, canonical tags, XML sitemaps, robots.txt, etc.</p>
